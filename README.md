# Universal Doom Weapons for VR

By design, this mod should allow the Doom 3D VR weapons working with the other map-packs and gameplay mods which don't change the monsters and weapon system too much from the vanilla Doom/Heretic/Hexen/Chex/Strife etc.

There are optional bullet tracer and particle/smoke (Enhanced mode) effects for the weapons available in the **3D weapons Settings**. When enhanced mode is enabled, the Super Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle and BFG will have alt-fire enabled. In vanilla mode only BFG has alt-fire enabled (Doom beta BFG effect as alt-fire).
