To install:

    Extract GZDoom-VR to a folder.
    Copy Original Doom wads into the folder.
    Copy 3D Weapons mod into the folder.
    Copy this mod into the folder.
    Run with gzdoomvr.exe -file HDVRweapons.zip LATEST_MOD_FILE_NAME
  
OR use ZDL: https://github.com/lcferrum/qzdl/releases to config all your Doom needs.

Currently this mod supports following iWads:
* Doom
* Doom 2
* Heretic
* Hexen
* Chex Quest
* Strife
* Freedoom
* Blasphemer
* Harmony
* The Adventures of Square
* Rise Of The Wool Ball
* FateDoom
* Fate: A Doom Total Conversion
* Project Osiris: Alien Breed 3D (a bit broken at the moment)

This mod has been specifically adapted to work well with these pWads:
* Death Foretold (D4T)
* Pirate Doom
* Consolidated Wolfenstein 3D TC


By design, this mod should allow the 3D weapons mod working with the other map-pack and gameplay mods which don't change the monsters and weapon system too much from the vanilla Doom/Heretic/Hexen/Chex/Strife etc.
